# Game Type 1: Majority Rules

Attention townsfolk of Cedar Creek, we've discovered an alien virus called has come to infect our town.
The alien hive has a queen who looks like one of us, but controls the infected. 
Thankfully we've found a way to turn someone, but unfortunately it's not perfect.
If we turn someone who is infected they become clean, but if we turn someone who is clean they become infected.
It also looks like the queen is always immune.
We've also created a machine that will count how many of us are infected (including the queen).

We only have enough to turn two people a night for five nights. 

Whoever is in the majority controls the hive, so make sure you end up on the right side.

## Setup

1. Everyone gets delt a role card.
2. Everyone gets delt a status card.

## Roles

### Townsperson

A townsperson is the base role. 

They are always either clean or infected. The only information they know is their own status and the number of infected.

Their motive is to end up in the majority by the morning of night six.

### Queen

The Queen is the leader of the hive.

They are always infected and will know everyone who is infected.

Their motive is to infect as many townsfolk as possible.
